# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters using Machine Learning algorithms. 
Early prediction of diabetes can help in timely medical intervention and better disease management.

The model is trained on historical health data and learns patterns associated with diabetes.
